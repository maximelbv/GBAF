# GBAF

<h1>GBAF(Groupement Banque Assurance Français)</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

Banking products and services are many and varied. In order to
best inform customers, employees of 340 bank branches and
insurance in France (agents, account managers, financial advisers, etc.)
search the Internet for information on banking products and
funders, among others.
Today, there is no database to search for this information from
reliably and quickly or to give its opinion on the partners and actors of the
banking sector, such as associations or solidarity funders.
To remedy this, the GBAF wishes to offer employees of large groups
French a single point of entry, listing a large amount of information
on the partners and actors of the group as well as on the products and services
banking and financial.
